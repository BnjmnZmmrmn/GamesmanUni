`jq` is the old `jquery` implementation of the project which will be dropped in later version.

`vue` is the current implementation of the project. I will eventually add what I did there and the design and package selection decision, but for now scan through it while consult this partially completed [documentation draft](https://www.notion.so/penguinlay/uni-doc-206603f433964d9ebe428727ab10892c).

Update:
I just realize the new version 1.0 I wrote didn't move over when I ported here, and I lost the whole new version. This version is a mess. And, I wrote version 1.0 in the past three days, but I lost it during the transition. I am going to rewrite the whole project from scratch so bear with me. Thanks!
